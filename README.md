# How to Play Minesweepers Game

Below are the rules of the Game

## Rules of Minesweepers Game

The game has some rules that needs to be followed for you to WIN. Otherwise, the Game would be Over and you will loose!!

1. Put a flag in all the cells that you think there is a bomb for you to win. Once you put the flags in all the correct cells (i.e. all the cells with a Bomb) you will win the Game! To put a flag on a cell "right click on that cell". You can also hold "control" and click/left click to do the same.
2. **Do not click on a cell with a bomb** (if you a using trackpad, if you are using a mouse, do not left click). You would need to guess correctly to only click on cells with no bombs in them
3. Once you click on a cell with Bomb, the game will be over and all the cells with Bombs will be displayed
4. If you click on a cell with no surrounding bombs, all the surrounding cells will unveil (in a recursive manner) until it reaches the edges of cells with at least one surrounding bomb, then it will stop.

1. Clone this repo or download the zip file in your machine.
2. Through the command line, navigate to the downloaded folder (you may need to unzip it if you have gone with the download option) and run **`npm install`** to install the project dependancies and libraries in your local machine
3. Once it has completed the installation, then run `npm start` to runs the app in the browser. \

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
